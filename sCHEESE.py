# TIME FUNCTIONS

import time

# The delay function will mimic the delay function which exists in an Arduino, although it is entirely feasible
# to also simply use time.sleep() if the user wishes to associate delays in larger units of time (i.e. seconds)

def delay(milliseconds):
    time.sleep(milliseconds / 1000)
    #print('time delay of  {0} millisecond(s)'.format(milliseconds/1000))

# The delayMicro function will mimic the same function in Arduino, with the purpose of being even shorter
# amount of time, intended for unique circumstances and hardware
