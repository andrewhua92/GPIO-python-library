Python library for the CARobot's HAT for the Raspberry Pi dubbed the 'SwissCHEESE'

Work in progress.

Uses the J8 Raspberry Pi GPIO Expansion, MCP3008 ADC, PCA9685 Driver & more.
Utilizes several Adafruit Integrated Circuit libraries as well as other common Python libraries.

Intended usage is for simpler access to pin I/O from the HAT while using this module and as well as easier command of motor use, PWM functionality and additional purposes.
